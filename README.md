This is my version of Discord designing and implementing the same features including text messaging, servers, roles, voice chat and file transfer. There's many different libraries tha need to be imported in order to run the application, including:
-Express
-Socket.io
-MongooseDB
-Cors

After the above mentioned libraries are imported the application can be tested, as of 06-22 it's still not completed.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
